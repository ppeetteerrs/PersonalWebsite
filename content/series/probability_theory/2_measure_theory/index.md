# 1 Introduction
Having developed the definition of Lebesgue measure, we now work in a more abstract setting where $\mathbb{R}^d$ is replaced by a general space $X$.

In order to define measure and integration on space $X$, we need:
1. $Set of measurable sets \mathcal{B} \in 2^X$
2. Measure $\mu : \mathcal{B} \rightarrow [0, +\infty]$

The triple $(X, \mathcal{B}, \mu)$ defines a measure space.
