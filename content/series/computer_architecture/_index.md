This is a series of notes that I made while reading the book [Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach](http://library.lol/main/DA2B809D2B7F21ED67CEC259E1B5E891). It is recommended that students who are unfamiliar with the topic read the book [Computer Organization and Design](http://library.lol/main/C58F3D5DD8B40771D8ECBFEDA52C6759) to gain a high-level overview of the concepts. This series of notes (and textbooks) will be based around the RISCV instruction set. However, the concepts should be universal.
