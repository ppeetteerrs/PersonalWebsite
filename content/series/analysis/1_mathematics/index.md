# 1 Why do we need to know why things work?

Mathematics, to most people, is a set of **problem-solving tools**. Just like how we how we use physical tools (e.g. a pair of scissors or a computer), we apply mathematical rules without the need to understand why they work.

Given the rules of arithmetics, we can perform calcuations such as $9 \div 3$ and be gauranteed that an answer can be found. However, having a rough sense of how mathematics (or any other tools) works can help us avoid certain pitfalls. The most common pitfall in applied mathematics is probably the "divide by zero" taboo. In certain scenarios (e.g. when solving differential equations), some maths intuition is necessary in order to avoid making such mistakes.

That comes to mathematical logic:
Propositional Logic
Predicate Logic (First-order logic)
